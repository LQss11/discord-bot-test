# Workflow
This project was created by runninng:
```sh
npm init
```
then to download discord js package:
```sh
npm install discord.js
```
then you will need to visit: [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) then select BOT on the left section and convert it into bot to get the token, that will allow us to communication with our discord server

To give bot some permissions visit this link [https://discordapi.com/permissions.html](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) copy client ID from bot then paste it and click on link to invite to the server

to launch bot run 
```sh
node .
```

Now once the bot is on your server and is online you can run the commands starting with the prefix specified and if the command file exists it will execute the code.
## NOTICE
MAKE SURE TO NOT PUSH THE TOKEN INTO THE INTERNET!
